# GetServerSideProps vs GetStaticProps in Next.js

In Next.js, we are presented with the option to utilize `GetServerSideProps`, a feature that facilitates data fetching exclusively on the server-side and abstains from execution on the client's browser. But what about `GetStaticProps`? Are you familiar with the distinctions between the two?

## The E-commerce Example

Imagine you're running an e-commerce platform dedicated to selling T-shirts. How often do you change the product images? Probably not very frequently, right? 

**The problem with employing `getServerSideProps`** is that every time our page is reloaded, it triggers an API call, consuming:
- ⏱️ Time
- 💾 Memory
- 🔄 Processing power

This ultimately results in a **slower page load**.

## Enter Static Site Generation (SSG)

Next.js offers functionality known as **Static Site Generation (SSG)**. Essentially, when dealing with pages that experience infrequent changes, we can implement a caching mechanism to present the same page version to all users. This concept is encapsulated in `GetStaticProps`.

## Important Consideration

Here's an important consideration: **When you switch to using `GetStaticProps`, you don't have access to the request context** (req, res, cookies, user infos). 

This is because this method runs during the build of your application and you provide a `revalidate` number. It means if you set it to 5 seconds, every 5 seconds, Next.js will create a new version of your page.

## Examples

### Using GetServerSideProps

```javascript
export async function getServerSideProps(context) {
  // Access the request context (context) here
  // Fetch data based on the request
  const data = await fetchData();

  // Return the data as props
  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
  };
}
```

**Key characteristics:**
- ✅ Runs on every request
- ✅ Has access to request context
- ✅ Good for dynamic, user-specific data
- ❌ Slower initial page load
- ❌ Can't be cached by CDN

### Using GetStaticProps

```javascript
export async function getStaticProps() {
  // Cannot access the request context (context) here
  // Fetch data for the static page
  const data = await fetchData();

  // Return the data as props
  return {
    props: {
      data,
    },
    // Revalidate property for dynamic regeneration
    revalidate: 5, // Regenerate every 5 seconds
  };
}
```

**Key characteristics:**
- ✅ Runs at build time
- ✅ Pages can be cached by CDN
- ✅ Extremely fast page loads
- ✅ Can use Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)
- ❌ No access to request context
- ❌ Not suitable for user-specific data

## When to Use Each?

### Use GetServerSideProps when:

- You need access to request-time information (cookies, headers, query params)
- Data is user-specific and can't be cached
- Content changes on every request
- You need authentication information

**Examples:**
- User dashboard with personalized data
- Shopping cart
- Admin panels
- Real-time data displays

### Use GetStaticProps when:

- Content doesn't change frequently
- Data is the same for all users
- Page can be pre-rendered at build time
- Performance is critical

**Examples:**
- Blog posts
- Product catalog
- Marketing pages
- Documentation

## Quick Reminder

**If your page requires dynamic information**, using `GetStaticProps` might not be suitable. This is because static pages are generated during build time, making it impractical when you need to dynamically alter information based on user-specific conditions.

## Comparison Table

| Feature | GetServerSideProps | GetStaticProps |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Runs** | Every request | Build time (+ revalidation) |
| **Context access** | ✅ Yes | ❌ No |
| **CDN caching** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| **Performance** | Slower | Faster |
| **Use case** | Dynamic data | Static/semi-static data |
| **ISR support** | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |

## Conclusion

Both `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` have their place in Next.js applications. The key is understanding your data requirements and choosing the right tool for the job:

- **Dynamic, user-specific data?** → `getServerSideProps`
- **Static or infrequently changing data?** → `getStaticProps`

By making the right choice, you can significantly improve your application's performance and user experience!
