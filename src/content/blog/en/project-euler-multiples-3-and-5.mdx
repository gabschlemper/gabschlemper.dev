# #1 Project Euler Problems

## Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

**Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the provided parameter.**

### Test Cases

The function should meet the following requirements:

- `multiplesOf3and5(10)` should return a number.
- `multiplesOf3and5(49)` should return 543.
- `multiplesOf3and5(1000)` should return 233168.
- `multiplesOf3and5(8456)` should return 16687353.
- `multiplesOf3and5(19564)` should return 89301183.

### Solution

Here's my approach to solving this problem:

```javascript
function multiplesOf3and5(number) {
  let sum = 0 
  for(let i = 1; i < number; i++) {
    if (i % 3 === 0 || i % 5 === 0) {
      sum += i
    }
  }
  
  return sum;
}
```

### Explanation

The solution is straightforward:

1. **Initialize a sum variable** to store the total
2. **Loop through all numbers** from 1 to the provided number (exclusive)
3. **Check if divisible** by 3 or 5 using the modulo operator (`%`)
4. **Add to sum** if the condition is met
5. **Return the final sum**

### Time Complexity

- **Time:** O(n) - We iterate through all numbers once
- **Space:** O(1) - We only use a constant amount of extra space

### Alternative Optimization

For very large numbers, there's a mathematical approach using the arithmetic series formula that runs in O(1) time, but the iterative solution works well for most practical cases.
